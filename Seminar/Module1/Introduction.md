# Introduction
We're actually using geometric algorithms all the time in everyday life. Some examples of geometric problems:
- Range searching
- Nearest neighbor finding
- Line segment intersections

Geometric algorithm also play a large role in applications. For instant:
- Computer graphics and computer aided design (CAD)
  - Geometry processing
  - Geometric modelling
- Motion planning in robotics
