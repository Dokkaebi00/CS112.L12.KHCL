# Computational Thinking
## Introduction
* **Computational thinking** is an approach to solving problems using concepts and ideas from computer science, and expressing solutions to those problems so that they can be run on a computer.
* **Computational thinking** is used everywhere by many different types of people such as **computer scientists, professionals in business, medicine, education, etc.** to solve real-world problems.
### Example of using computational thinking in real life
Students used **Computational Thinking** skills to perform literary analysis on books like Hamlet and Harry Potter. Students developed network diagrams and interaction graphs to abstract the different connections between characters.
### Pillars of Computational Thinking
There are four what we call pillars to **Computational Thinking** 
1. [Decomposition](##Decomposition)
2. [Pattern Recognition](##Pattern-Recognition)
3. [Abstraction](##Abstraction)
4. [Algorithms](##Algorithms)
