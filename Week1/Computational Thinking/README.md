# Computational Thinking
## Introduction
* **Computational thinking** is an approach to solving problems using concepts and ideas from computer science, and expressing solutions to those problems so that they can be run on a computer.
* **Computational thinking** is used everywhere by many different types of people such as **computer scientists, professionals in business, medicine, education, etc.** to solve real-world problems.
### Example of using **Computational Thinking** in real life
* Students used **Computational Thinking** skills to perform literary analysis on books like Hamlet and Harry Potter. Students developed network diagrams and interaction graphs to abstract the different connections between characters.
* **Play game** - In League of legends, we plan how to beat the enemies by choose the good champion that counter enemies's champion wekk, pick the right runes or buy suitable items to beat the enemies.
### Pillars of Computational Thinking
There are four what we call pillars to **Computational Thinking** 
1. [Decomposition](##Decomposition)
2. [Pattern Recognition](##Pattern-Recognition)
3. [Abstraction](##Abstraction)
4. [Algorithms](##Algorithms)

## Decomposition
The power of **Computational Thinking** start with **Decomposition**, which is the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. With **Decompostion**, problems that seem overwhelming at first become much more manageable.
> *“If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.”* George Pólya
### Examples of **Decomposition**
- **Learn a new language** - Students learn about sentence structure in a foreign languge by breaking it down into different parts like subject, verb, and object.
- **Programming a new game** - Students need to consider the story of the game, environment, characters, as well as consider how different actions will take place, how it will be deployed, and so much more.
## Pattern Recognition
**Pattern Recognition** means finding similarities or shared characteristics within or between problem and allows us to use the same solution for each occurence of the pattern.
### Examples of **Pattern Recognition**
- **Social Media Site: Photo Albums** -  Facebook, Instagram or many other form of social media have to handle the upload of an album of photos. Each of photo in the album would first be analyzed for metadata and after that, compressed images. then metadata and images stored in data server. Although the photos are different, the processing of each photos is the same. So that we can use **pattern recognition**
- **Recommendation system** - When Netflix, Spotify, Youtube, etc. recommends shows based on your interests. The recommendation system rely on **pattern recognition**.
- **Programming a game** - When coding a game, we may recognize similar objects, patterns, and actions. Finding these allows us to apply the same, or slightly modified some objects or actions in the game, which makes our programming more efficient.
## Abstraction
In Data representation and abstraction, we determine what characteristics of the problem are important and filter out those that are not. Using these to create a representation of the problem to be solved.
### Examples of **Abstraction**
- **Students infomation** - We managing students in the contexts of university for course registration by colecting some **inportant** infomations like name, ID, phone number, etc. and we don't need to collect **unimportant** infomations like favorite color, shoe size, etc...
- **Programming a game** - When we make a racing game in the city, we have to make a lot of houses for the city and what we need is focus on exterior designs of these houses, not the interior.
## Algorithms
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions of how to solve a problem. It identifies what is to be done and the order in which they should be done. It can be described in human language, as a flowchart, or by using pseudo code.
### Examples of **Algorithms**
**How to make a cup of tea**
1. Customer want black or herbal tea?
2. `If` black tea -> set `Temperature = 212`, `else` -> set `Temperature = 180`
3. Put type teabag in cup
4. Fill electric kettle with water
5. Heat water to value of `Temperature`
6. Remove teabag
7. Enjoy!
