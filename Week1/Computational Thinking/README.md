# Computational Thinking
## Introduction
* **Computational thinking** is an approach to solving problems using concepts and ideas from computer science, and expressing solutions to those problems so that they can be run on a computer.
* **Computational thinking** is used everywhere by many different types of people such as **computer scientists, professionals in business, medicine, education, etc.** to solve real-world problems.
### Example of using computational thinking in real life
Students used **Computational Thinking** skills to perform literary analysis on books like Hamlet and Harry Potter. Students developed network diagrams and interaction graphs to abstract the different connections between characters.
### Pillars of Computational Thinking
There are four what we call pillars to **Computational Thinking** 
1. [Decomposition](##Decomposition)
2. [Pattern Recognition](##Pattern-Recognition)
3. [Abstraction](##Abstraction)
4. [Algorithms](##Algorithms)

## Decomposition
The power of **Computational Thinking** start with **Decomposition**, which is the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. With **Decompostion**, problems that seem overwhelming at first become much more manageable.
> *“If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.”* George Pólya
### Examples of Decomposition
- **Learn a new language** - Students learn about sentence structure in a foreign languge by breaking it down into different parts like subject, verb, and object.
- **Programming a new game** - Students need to consider the story of the game, environment, characters, as well as consider how different actions will take place, how it will be deployed, and so much more.
